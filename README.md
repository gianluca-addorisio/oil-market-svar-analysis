# Oil Market Structural VAR Analysis

### Structural Identification of Oil Supply, Demand, and Precautionary Shocks with Industrial Applications

This repository contains a **fully reproducible econometric and applied pipeline** for the structural analysis of global oil-market dynamics using Vector Autoregressions (VAR) and Structural VARs (SVAR).

The project was developed as a **Bachelor’s thesis in Industrial Engineering** and is designed to bridge **academic macro-energy econometrics** with **practical risk-management and decision-support applications** for energy-exposed firms.

## 1. Data and Methodology

### Frequency and Coverage

* **Monthly data**: January 1990 – December 2024

### Core Variables

* Real WTI crude oil price
* Oil production
* OECD activity index (proxy for global demand)
* Oil inventories
* Jet fuel prices

### Preprocessing

* Log transformations
* Stationarity enforcement
* Standardization for VAR estimation

---

## 2. Econometric Framework

* Reduced-form VAR with diagnostic-based lag selection
* Structural identification via **sign restrictions**

### Inference Tools

* Impulse Response Functions (IRFs)
* Forecast Error Variance Decompositions (FEVDs)
* Bootstrap confidence intervals
* Explicit analysis of **distributional asymmetries and tail risk**

The identification strategy follows the oil-market literature (e.g. Kilian; Kilian & Murphy) and focuses on **economically interpretable structural shocks**, including:

* Oil supply shocks
* Aggregate demand shocks
* Precautionary (inventory-driven) demand shocks

---

## 3. Industrial Applications

Structural results are translated into **decision-relevant risk scenarios**, including:

### Scenario Generation

* Monte Carlo simulation of oil-price paths conditional on identified structural shocks

### Stress Testing

* Geopolitical supply disruptions
* Demand collapses and demand booms
* Inventory-driven price spikes

### Hedging Analysis

* Futures
* Swaps
* Option-based strategies

### Sectoral Case Study

* Airline-sector application linking oil shocks to:

  * Jet fuel prices
  * Cost-at-Risk metrics
  * Downside exposure measures

| Component                | MATLAB | Python |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ------ |
| Dataset construction     | ✅      | ✅      |
| VAR estimation           | ✅      | ✅      |
| SVAR (sign restrictions) | ✅      | ✅      |
| Monte Carlo scenarios    | ✅      | ⏳      |
| Stress testing           | ✅      | ⏳      |
| Hedging applications     | ✅      | ⏳      |

⏳ = in progress

The MATLAB implementation is complete.
The Python re-implementation focuses on **reproducibility, modularity, and extensibility**.

## 5. Reproducibility

Generated datasets and model outputs are stored in:

```
data/processed/
```

This directory is intentionally **excluded from version control**.

All results can be fully regenerated by running the pipeline scripts from **raw data ingestion to final outputs**.

---

## 6. Project Positioning

This repository sits at the intersection of:

* Macro-energy econometrics
* Quantitative risk analysis
* Industrial decision support

Relative to standard reduced-form VAR analyses, the framework emphasizes:

* Structural interpretability
* Scenario-based risk assessment
* Applicability to real-world energy and commodity exposure
